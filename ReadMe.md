1. <b>Test Program</b>
<p>Small Python program I made that takes in an input of integers multiplies each by 4 and then adds 8. Writes the output to a textfile. I needed this for a part-time job I had where the the test scores needs to be multiplied by 4 and + 8. </p>
2. <b>finder</b>
<br>
</p>Program that finds the largest value in a list</p>
3. <b>linkedlist</b>

<p>Python program that demo's a simple linkedlist. Wanted to study how it works in python compared to Java</p>
4. <b>reader</b>

<p>Python program that reads in a text file and prints it out via terminal. I was just playing with simple I/O in python</p>
5. <b>stack</b>
<br>
<p>Python program that implements the a simple stack data structure. Again much like the linkedList just wanted to see how it functions
in Python programming language<p>
